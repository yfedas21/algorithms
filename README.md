## Cool algorithms repository
This repository will be a place I can store different algorithms I work on for CS473 or, less often, MA360 (Number Theory with Dr. Moyer). I usually just use an online Python interpreter and submit a link, but I figured that a repo would be of better use to me. Students from either of those classes, if you're going to copy my work, at least give me a star... I swear it won't be used against you.

#### List of algorithms from CS473
+ [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/yfedas21/algorithms/blob/master/CS473/sieve.py "what the huh")
+ [BFS](https://github.com/yfedas21/algorithms/blob/master/CS473/BFS_algorithm.py "bad breadth")
+ DFS

#### List of algorithms from MA360
+ A cool linear [solution](https://github.com/yfedas21/algorithms/blob/master/MA360/find_sums_from_primes.py "do your own hw") to an exercise from *A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory* by Silverman.
